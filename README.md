# Sheypoor Interview Task

## Task Description

Consider the following infinite sequence:
```
  0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 12, 7, 10, 8, 9, ...
```
The **0th** element is `0` and the **1st** element is `1`. **Each of the next elements is equal to the sum of the digits
of the previous two elements.**
I must write a function that takes the number **`n`** (between **0** and **1,000,000,000**) as input and it
returns the **`nth`** member of the above sequence.
